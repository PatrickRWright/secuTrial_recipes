# secuTrial recipes

This repository's purpose is to supply step-by-step recipes for common tasks in secuTrial. As you can see below, the recipes are classified into basic recipes and advanced recipes. The basic recipes are intended to give people who are new to secuTrial a starting point. Advanced recipes can help more experienced users in deploying non-standard setups. 

If you would like to contribute a recipe then please name it by the two or three words describing it best and add it to the index below.
